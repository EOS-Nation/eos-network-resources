# 6. Cap EOS supply at 2B tokens

## Introduction

- Turn off inflation
- Mint ~818M EOS
- Cap EOS supply at 2B tokens
- Release newly minted tokens over period of time with aggressive release in the beginning tapering over time.

Dilute those not participating (~85% of EOS holders) rewarding those who are participating.

# Overview

## Block Producers (BPs) Compensation:

- **Adjusted Allocation:** 8% of the newly minted tokens (~65.44 million EOS).
- **Distribution Method:** Decreases annually following a logarithmic curve.

## Staking Rewards:

- **Adjusted Allocation:** 38% of the newly minted tokens (~310.84 million EOS).
- **Distribution Method:** Front-loaded, gradually decreasing over the distribution period.

## Market Makers:

- **Adjusted Allocation:** 9% of the newly minted tokens (~73.62 million EOS).
- **Distribution Method:** Evenly distributed over the first 5 years.

## Active Holders Reward:

- **Adjusted Allocation:** 18% of the newly minted tokens (~147.24 million EOS).
- **Distribution Method:** Rewards for active participation, decreasing logarithmically over 10 years.

## Ecosystem Development Fund:

- **Adjusted Allocation:** 17% of the newly minted tokens (~139.06 million EOS).
- **Distribution Method:** Managed by EOS LABS and a new pillar focused on EOS UX, with a focus on early development and tapering off.

## EOS Network Foundation for Antelope Development:

- **New Allocation:** 10% of the newly minted tokens (~81.8 million EOS).
- **Purpose:** Dedicated to the continuous development and improvement of the Antelope software, ensuring EOS remains competitive and innovative. This fund would support core development, infrastructure improvements, and community-driven projects that enhance the Antelope protocol, which would move to a Business Source License from Leap 6.0 on.

# Active Holders Rewards

### 1. Staking Participation Rewards:

- **Mechanism:** Reward users based on the amount and duration of their staking. Implement a tiered system where longer-term stakers receive a higher percentage of rewards, encouraging long-term holding and network stability.

- **Impact:** Increases token lock-up, reducing circulating supply pressure and promoting price stability.

### 2. Voting and Governance Engagement:

- **Mechanism:** Incentivize participation in governance decisions, including voting for block producers, proposals for network upgrades, and other governance-related activities. Rewards could be distributed based on the frequency and consistency of participation.

- **Impact:** Enhances decentralized governance and ensures a broad representation of the community in decision-making processes.

### 3. DeFi and dApp Usage Incentives:

- **Mechanism:** Reward users for interacting with EOS-based decentralized applications (dApps) and DeFi platforms. This could include participation in liquidity pools, usage of decentralized exchanges (DEXs), or engagement with social and gaming dApps.

- **Impact:** Drives adoption and usage of EOS dApps, fostering a vibrant ecosystem.


### 4. Educational Achievements:

- **Mechanism:** Offer rewards for completing educational modules, tutorials, or contributing to the EOS knowledge base. This could extend to hosting workshops, writing articles, or creating tutorials that benefit the wider community.

- **Impact:** Enhances community knowledge, increases network security and engagement, and encourages the development of high-quality content.


5. Community and Social Engagement:

- **Mechanism:** Implement a reward system for users who actively participate in community-building activities. This could include moderating community forums, hosting meetups, participating in AMAs, or contributing to open-source projects within the EOS ecosystem.

- **Impact:** Strengthens the EOS community, fosters a sense of belonging among members, and promotes EOS on a wider scale.


6. Bug Bounty and Security Improvements:

- **Mechanism:** Reward community members who identify bugs, vulnerabilities, or propose significant security improvements. This could be structured as a formal bug bounty program with tiered rewards based on the severity and impact of the findings.

- **Impact:** Enhances the security and robustness of the EOS network and its dApps, encouraging a proactive approach to security.


7. Creative and Innovative Contributions:

- **Mechanism:** Incentivize unique contributions that enhance the EOS ecosystem, such as developing new user interfaces, creating innovative smart contract solutions, or pioneering novel use cases for EOS.

- **Impact:** Stimulates innovation and diversity in the EOS ecosystem, leading to new developments and applications.
