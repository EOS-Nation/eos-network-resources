# EOS Network Resources

## Core principles

<details>
<summary><b>Network security</b></summary>

- Voter participation must not decrease
- Network must not be at increased risk

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Code security</b></summary>

- Minimal system contract modifications
- No risk of loss of funds
- Code review should contain minimal code complexity

</details>

## Proposals

<summary><b>1. ‚úÖ Modify RAM increase rate</b></summary>

> [Introduction & Motivation](https://github.com/EOS-Nation/eos-network-resources/tree/main/1.%20Modify%20RAM%20Increase%20Rate)

### Proposal

Set RAM increase rate to 0 bytes per block.

- `eosio::setramrate` to `bytes_per_block=0`

### MSIG

- https://bloks.io/msig/eosnationftw/setramrate

### Considerations
- Allow for signed integer for `bytes_per_block` RAM rate (allows deflationary virtual RAM supply)

<summary><b>2. ‚òëÔ∏è Removal of Deferred Transactions from System Contract</b></summary>

> [Introduction & Motivation](https://github.com/EOS-Nation/eos-network-resources/tree/main/2.%20Remove%20Deferred%20Transactions%20from%20System%20Contract)

### Proposal
[Deploy latest v3.2.0 system contract](https://github.com/eosnetworkfoundation/eos-system-contracts/releases/tag/v3.2.0)

- Within the system contracts the actions `system_contract::bidname`, `system_contract::buyram`, `wrap::exec` no longer issue deferred transactions.
- This is a change for the `system_contract::bidname` action, and failed bids will need an explict refund. For the `system_contract::buyram` action the default behavior remains unchanged.
- The `wrap::exec` action has been rewritten to use send instead of `send_deferred`.

<summary><s><b>3. üöß Staking Rewards</b></s></summary>

> [Introduction & Motivation](https://github.com/EOS-Nation/eos-network-resources/tree/main/3.%20Staking%20Rewards)

### Proposal

Revamp REX with modified parameters, increased allocation by 2% & burn system fees.

- Burn mechanism for system fees (Name Bids, RAM fee, PowerUp fees, more...)
  - All system fees are burned (sent to `eosio.null`)
  - Could cause the network to be deflationary
- REX to accept a portion of unallocated inflation
  - modify `producer_pay::claimrewards` to support `rex::channel_to_rex`
  - define new `rexparams` table with
    - `inflation_rex_factor=50000` (50% of unallocated inflation)
    - `num_of_maturity_buckets=5` (4 days)
  - define new `setrexparams` action to modify `inflation_rex_factor` & `num_of_maturity_buckets`
- Increase +2% of unallocated inflation going to REX
  - call `eosio::setinflation` action with the following parameters:
    - `annual_rate=500` (previously 300)
    - `inflation_pay_factor=50000` (previously 30000)
- Remove `check_voting_requirement` checks from `buyrex`
  - resolves circular dependencies between `delegatebw`, `voteproducer`, and `buyrex`. [#51](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio.system/issues/51)
  - allows for neutral actors to participate in REX (ex: EOS EVM Bridge)

### Considerations
- Increase REX staking period
  - modify `num_of_maturity_buckets=8` to change staking period from 4 days to 7 days
- Prevent REX liquid staking
  - modify `mvtosavings` and `mvfrsavings` to be a requirement for `buyrex`
  - matured REX loans should automatically trigger `sellrex` action

<summary><b>4. üöß Increase maximum transaction time</b></summary>

> [Introduction & Motivation](https://github.com/EOS-Nation/eos-network-resources/tree/main/4.%20Increase%20Maximum%20Transaction%20Time)

### Operations

**[Deployment of Leap 5.0.0](https://github.com/AntelopeIO/leap/releases/tag/v5.0.0-rc3) (stable release)**

- Assuming default of 30 ms for `max-transaction-time`, that effectively raises the CPU time available by 5x to 150 ms.
- Leap 5.0.0 brings the selective EOS VM OC feature which may increase some computations in EOS EVM by a similar multiplier.
- That is already getting us a significant gain in computation capacity per EOS transaction which should translate to higher overall gas limits per EVM transaction (assuming 1 EVM transaction per EOS transaction).

### No Change

- There is no need at the moment to further raise `max_transaction_cpu_usage` for the purposes of EOS EVM.

<summary><b>5. üößüìñ PowerUp technical improvements</b></summary>

> [Introduction & Motivation](https://github.com/EOS-Nation/eos-network-resources/tree/main/5.%20PowerUp%20technical%20improvements)

### Proposal

Introduce an enhanced Powerup utility "wrapper" function designed to facilitate user interaction with the native Powerup action in a seamless manner.

- implement `powerup2` action
  - Make a payment using a set amount of EOS (ex: "I want to pay 1 EOS")
  - Lease a specific duration of CPU time (ex: "I want 10ms of CPU")
  - Abstract NET allocations, ensuring that each CPU allocation is accompanied by a NET allocation at a fixed 1:10 ratio.

### No Change

- Powerup CPU/NET ratios remain unchanged
